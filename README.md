## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Davi Figueiredo, a Computer Engineering student at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT) in Brazil.
My engineering background provides me with a unique perspective, allowing me to connect low-level systems theory, like memory management and hardware, with the complex architecture of modern applications. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in decentralized Web3 technologies
I'm always looking for challenging projects and opportunities to apply my knowledge and learn through hands-on experience.
